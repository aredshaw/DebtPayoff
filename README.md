# DebtPayoff
A tool to help you get out of debt quicker

## Why I Wrote It

Years ago I needed to know how long it would take me to pay off my credit card the suggested interest rate. Using a calculator to do compound interest made no sense, so I created this. I discovered that the rate they suggested would take me longer than I would live, so I increased my monthly payment and saw an actual date I could expect to be finished. I used it for my college loans as well.
## Features

* Simple interface: Just enter the fields application and click submit
* Shows payment progress with dates
* Reveals when you will have completely paid off your debt
* Tells you how much interest you have paid overall
* All data can be copied and pasted into other applications
* Runs on any hardware (written in Java)

#### To copy and paste all of the output context (Windows & Linux)
* Click inside the box with the text. Use CTRL-A (simultaneously hold down the "CTRL: button and the "A" button) on your keyboard to select all text
* CTRL-C (copies the text)
* In the other application such as MS Word, Notepad, etc., click on the program, then CTRL-V (to paste text)

#### For a Mac
* Command-A (Select all)
* Command-C (Copy)
* Command-V (Paste)

My hope is that by seeing how much overall you will save by paying an extra $10 or $20 per month, you will be greatly encouraged to pay the debt off that much faster. This application was written in 100% pure Java, so you will need to download sun's [Jave Runtime Environment(JRE)](https://www.java.com/en/download/) for it to work.

Download the program from the link below. Then double click the downloaded DebtPayoff.jar file and that's it.

Enjoy!
