When you are in debt, the last thing you need is to have to pay for software to
help you manage your debt.  For this reason, I created an application which can
help you pay off your debt a bit wiser if not quicker.  I developed this tool
out of a need myself to find out when, if ever, at the current rate, my credit
card would be paid off.  I discovered that at the current rate it would take
far longer to pay off my debt than I had expected.  Since this program is
written in Java, it will run on Windows (95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, XP), Linux, Mac,
Solaris and a great many other Operating Systems.  <br><br>With this program you
can discover: 

<ul>
<li>How many years/months it will take you to pay off your credit card
</li><li>The actual date the card will be paid off at the current rate
</li><li>A payment by payment breakdown of what you will spend
</li><li>How much will be spent on interest overall at that rate.
</li></ul>

You can also use this for other loans.   For instance, I use it for my college
loan.
<br><br>
The hope is that by seeing how much overall you will save by paying an extra $10 or $20 per month, you will be greatly encouraged to pay the debt off that much faster.

This application was written in 100% pure Java, so you will need to download
sun's Jave Runtime Environment(JRE).<br><br><center>

I pray that this software will be of some use to someone in an effort to get out
of debt.  Some good articles on money management can also be found at
